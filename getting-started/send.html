<h3 class="subheader">I want operational metrics</h3>

<p>
There are quite a few tools already to help you on your way to getting operational metrics rolling in to your system.
Probably one of the most popular of these tools is collectd, collectd is a daemon that runs on your servers and collects
any system metrics you want using its full and extendable plugin system. collectd can be configured to send data right
to your graphite server with minimal effort.

<h3 class="subheader">I want business/product metrics</h3>

<p>
Tracking business and product metrics is easy with StatsD, it is really a matter of installing a proper StatsD client
and adding a few lines to your code to start seeing metrics come in.
